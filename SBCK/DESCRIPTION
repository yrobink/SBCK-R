Description: This library implements several recent bias correction methods with
             a unified interface to facilitate their use. In addition, a high
             dimensional hollow histogram algorithm is provided for the OTC and
             dOTC methods. The QM method has been implemented in the most
             generic way possible: the laws of the biased/reference data can be
             estimated parametrically or non-parametrically, with or without
             fixing the law.

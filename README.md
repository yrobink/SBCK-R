# SBCK (Statistical Bias Correction Kit)

## Features
- python3 and R version
- c++ independent files for Sparse Histogram
- Implement classic methods of bias correction (see [1,6] for the definition of bias correction)
- Quantile Mapping [2,3,4] and CDFt methods [5] 
- OTC and dOTC methods [6]

## R instruction

Requires:
- R
- roxygen2
- devtools
- Rcpp
- RcppEigen
- methods
- R6

Just run:
```
Rscript build.R -c -v -i
```

## Examples

For bias correction example, X0 and X1 are respectively the random variable to correct in calibration and
projection period. Y0 is the reference during calibration period. Z0 and Z1 are the corrections during calibration
and projection period.
